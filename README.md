This is a loose collection of tools that support reproducible
computing using literate programming.

It is *not* a library, and it is *not* a framework; rather, a
description to an approach to computing and documentation, along with
tools that support this approach.

The name, `lire`, stands for **li**terate, **re**producible computing.

For more information on dependencies and installation, see INSTALL.

For a detailed description of the approach, the tools, and the
possible uses, see the Tutorial and the Manual.
