This is a loose collection of tools that support reproducible computing using literate programming.

It is *not* a library, and it is *not* a framework; rather, a description to an approach to computing and documentation, along with tools that support this approach.

The name, `lira`, stands for **li**terate, **re**producible computing.

For more information on dependencies and installation, see INSTALL.

For an introduction to some possible uses, see the Quickstart Guide.

For a detailed description of the approach and the tools, see the Tutorial and the Manual.
