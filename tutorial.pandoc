## Exploratory Data Analysis
Ask questions and obtain answers based on the available data.

The goal is to document _the process_ of:

- explaining the rationale
- formulating the questions
- preparing and analyzing the data
- interpreting the results
- summarizing and presenting the results

How can `lire` aid that process?
